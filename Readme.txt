1) calculation with CAMB
 Go to https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/toolbox/tb_camb_form.cfm
 
 change the "Use Physical Parameters?" to "No", then change \Omega_{cdm} and \Omega_{baryon} to the value I used in my paper
 
 click "go", then it will generate the calculated result. Download the corresponding file.
 
 2) download Plank 2018 result from https://pla.esac.esa.int/
 
 3) put all these files in one folder, run the script PlanckCMBspe.m in matlab, it will generate Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 in my paper
